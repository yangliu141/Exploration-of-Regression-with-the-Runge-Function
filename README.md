# FYS-STK3155_Project1

Group members: William Schjerve Moe, Hallvard Hareide, Max Følstad-Andresen & Yang Liu

In this project, we will focus on the Runge function. We will fit polynomials of different degrees using OLS, Ridge and Lasso to evaluate model performance for the different complexities. Moreover we will also implement gradient decent methods as iterative alternatives and use resampling techniques to explore the bias-variance tradeoff. 

The required packages for running the code can be installed by pip install -r requirements.txt

The notebook exercisesweek39.ipynb in the week39 folder in the code folder are used for the exercises week 39. The code produces a plot illustrating the Bias-Variance trade-off and a heatmap showing the MSE of a Ridge regression model for various polynomial degrees and lambda values.
