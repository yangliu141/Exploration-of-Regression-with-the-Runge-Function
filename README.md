# FYS-STK3155_Project1

Group members: William Schjerve Moe, Hallvard Hareide, Max Følstad-Andresen & Yang Liu

In this project, we will focus on the Runge function. We will fit polynomials of different degrees using OLS, Ridge and Lasso to evaluate model performance for the different complexities. Moreover we will also implement gradient decent methods as iterative alternatives and use resampling techniques to explore the bias-variance tradeoff. 

The required packages for running the code can be installed by pip install -r requirements.txt
